# The SOC

Welcome to the SOC's official website source code. Below is a list of the stuff we want to work on:
- [x] Add our lovely security-obsessed camel logo
- [x] Change the color palette to match our branding
- [ ] Professional & consistent copywriting
- [ ] Make the members list more interesting. (Design-wise and accept more data about each member - see members.json)
- [ ] Make an event list (Past and upcoming)
- [ ] Add an FAQ and resources sections
